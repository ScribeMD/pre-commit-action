      If "true," run the Commitizen action on push to main to commit a version
      bump and tag a release if there are any release-worthy changes. Commitizen
      relies on tags in order to perform an incremental release, so you must pass
      fetch-depth: 0 to the official GitHub checkout action unless bump is
      "false."
